# Machine Learning Engineer Career Path — Codecademy

This repository contains my personal work and project artifacts from the **Machine Learning Engineer Career Path** offered by Codecademy.  
It includes all scripts, notebooks, datasets (when licensing allows), and documentation produced as I progress through the course syllabus.  
The goal of this repository is to track my learning journey, consolidate my code in one place, and serve as a reference portfolio for future use.

## Course Overview
The **Machine Learning Engineer Career Path** is an in-depth program covering machine learning theory, implementation, and software engineering best practices.  
It combines practical coding projects with conceptual learning, guiding students from fundamentals to advanced machine learning topics and end-to-end pipeline deployment.
